# Stone-Paper-Scissor
This is a simple game made with simple concepts of C++. 
The main logic is 'rand()' function gives us any random number which is divided by 3 and 1 is added to th remainder(in case the number is dividible by 3,as we don't want 0). 
So the number will be between 1 to 3. 1,2 & 3 are assigned with stone, paper and scissor respectively. It is asked to user to choose a number from 1 2 and 3. 
Then there is block of else if code which compares the input from user and the number generated by computer, accordingly there are 2 counters for user and computer which incriments when point is scored, in the last they both are compared and one with high score wins.
